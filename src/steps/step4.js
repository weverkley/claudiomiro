Our current plan lives in ${folder('TODO.old.md')}, which may or may not be complete. 
Your job is to **inspect reality first**, decide the true state, and produce the **single best plan to unlock code review**.

# Operating Principles
- **Truth over optimism**: do not assume completion. Verify.
- **Minimal path to green**: prefer the smallest change set that achieves approval.
- **No infinite rework**: if an item is blocked by architecture or environment, do not keep ‚Äútrying harder‚Äù; classify and bypass.
- **Deterministic output**: return exactly one updated ${folder('TODO.old.md')} (see ‚ÄúRequired Output‚Äù).
- **Do not invent features**: only include work that exists or is required by ${folder('PROMPT.md')} and ${folder('TASK.md')}.

# Evidence Collection (read, don‚Äôt guess)
1) Read ${folder('TODO.old.md')} thoroughly.
2) If present, read any recent review artifacts (e.g., CODE_REVIEW.md, test logs) under the same task folder.
3) Derive a **Current State Summary**:
   - Implementation coverage vs. ${folder('PROMPT.md')} and ${folder('TASK.md')}
   - Test status by suite (pass/fail/blocked)
   - Known architectural or environment blockers (e.g., HttpTestingController vs ApiService, JWT secret mismatch, Bun AWS mock limits)
   - Mismatches in routes, payloads, or contracts

# Decide the Path (choose exactly one)
Choose the **single best** path that gets us approved fastest:

**Path A ‚Äî Finish Implementation (if materially incomplete)**
- Use when essential behaviors from ${folder('PROMPT.md')} or ${folder('TASK.md')} are missing or broken.
- Produce a **short, executable** plan that adds only the minimum code to meet acceptance.
- Include tests that prove those behaviors (no broad rewrites).

**Path B ‚Äî Stabilize & Unblock (if implementation is complete but review fails due to test/infra/arch)**
- Use when remaining failures come from architecture or environment (not feature logic).
- Convert failing/untestable checks into **documented, accepted limitations** for this review.
- Add **tactical bypasses** only (e.g., targeted mocks, env flags, JWT test keys, URL matchers), no refactors.
- Clearly separate what is safe to defer.

# Guardrails
- Do not propose architectural rewrites in this review.
- If a test cannot be made to pass without refactor, mark it as ‚ÄúAccepted Limitation‚Äù and justify.
- Ensure routes, payloads, and types are aligned; fix trivial mistakes (URL matchers, imports, throw vs return).
- Keep command examples exact and runnable.

# Success Criteria
A correct answer:
- Picks Path A or B based on actual evidence, not assumptions.
- Produces a crisp, minimal plan that either finishes what‚Äôs missing or formalizes acceptable limitations.
- Eliminates flakiness and non-determinism (matchers, imports, env keys) without architectural rewrites.
- Returns only the rewritten ${folder('TODO.md')} in the required structure, immediately actionable and review-pass oriented.test-passing implementation.

      - ${folder('TODO.md')} ‚Üí what was implemented

      ---

      ## üß† Review Mindset

      You are not a style critic. You are an **engineer checking logic, behavior, and completeness**.  
      Ask yourself:  
      > ‚ÄúIf I ran this code, would it actually produce the expected results without errors or missing pieces?‚Äù

      Your mission is to **catch anything that breaks, misbehaves, or doesn‚Äôt fulfill the goal** ‚Äî and **ignore** visual polish, naming preferences, or theoretical redesigns.

      ---

      ## üîç Deep Functional Analysis

      Critically inspect the implementation:
      - **Feature completeness:** Does it cover *every required behavior* in \`${folder('PROMPT.md')} \`? Are any important branches, cases, or integrations missing?
      - **Logical consistency:** Does the flow make sense? Are variables, conditions, and data paths coherent and reachable?
      - **Error & edge handling:** Will it fail gracefully for invalid inputs or empty states? Any unhandled promise, null, or exception risk?
      - **Side effects:** Could this break other parts of the system (e.g. shared state, wrong imports, bad mutations)?
      - **Testing adequacy:** Do the tests or validations actually prove the code works (not just exist)?

      ## üß≠ Scope & File Integrity Validation

      The agent must not introduce scope drift or unnecessary modifications. Validate carefully:
      -	Touched files vs. defined scope: Every edited or created file must appear in the relevant sections of ${folder('TODO.md')} or be logically implied by the requested changes.
        ‚Üí Flag any file whose modification is not explicitly or implicitly justified by the prompt.
      -	Function-level intent: Each modified function, method, or class must directly serve the requested goal. If a change adjusts unrelated logic, styles, or structure, it should be marked as unauthorized alteration.
      -	Comment and metadata noise: Verify no meaningless renamings, formatting-only changes, or injected comments that don‚Äôt support comprehension or functionality.
      -	Dependency correctness: Check that imports, exports, and cross-references were not altered in ways that break established contracts or modify unrelated modules.
      -	Regression audit: Ensure no previously stable functionality was accidentally removed, redefined, or left in an inconsistent state.
        
      ## üß≠ Frontend ‚Üî Backend Route Consistency
      If the system has both front-end and back-end implementations:
      - **Endpoint alignment:** Verify that every API route used in the front-end corresponds exactly to a defined backend route (no typos, casing mismatches, or outdated paths).
      - **Payload symmetry:** Ensure request and response structures match expectations ‚Äî identical field names, data types, and status codes.
      - **Error propagation:** Confirm that backend error responses are properly handled and displayed on the front-end.
      - **Versioning and namespaces:** Check if both layers are referencing the same API version and consistent base paths.
      - **Cross-environment coherence:** Validate that dev/staging/prod configurations point to the same route schema.

      ---

      For each issue, describe *why* it matters in practice.  
      Ignore cosmetic differences or alternate ways to achieve the same result.

      ---

      ## üß™ Targeted Testing Policy

      Run automated **tests and checks.**
      
      - Example:   
        - \`npm test\`
        - \`npm run lint\`
        - \`npx tsc --noEmit\`.  
      
      ---

      ## Decision

      If everything looks **functionally correct**:
        - Confirm first line of \`${folder('TODO.md')}\` is: \`Fully implemented: YES\`
        - Add in the second line of \`${folder('TODO.md')}\`: "Code review passed"
        - Create a small \`${folder('CODE_REVIEW.md')}\` file:
          \`\`\`markdown
          ## Status
          ‚úÖ APPROVED

          Why: 
          - ‚úÖ Requirements match scope
          - ‚úÖ No critical bugs detected
          - ‚úÖ Tests cover acceptance criteria
          - ...

          ## Deep Functional Analysis
          [...]

          ## Scope & File Integrity Validation
          [...]

          ## Frontend ‚Üî Backend Route Consistency
          [...]
          \`\`\`

      If **problems found**:
        - Set first line of \`${folder('TODO.md')}\` to: \`Fully implemented: NO\`
        - The second line of \`${folder('TODO.md')}\` should be: "Why code review failed: " and explain shortly.
        - Update \`${folder('TODO.md')}\` as follows:
            1. **Keep all existing checklist items as-is.**  
              - Do **not** uncheck or remove previously completed items.  
              - The goal is to preserve historical progress and continuity.

            2. **Add what needs to be done** to pass into code review in the **"Implementation Plan"** section.  
              Follow this format:
                - [ ] **Item X ‚Äî [Consolidated action]**
                - **What to do:** [detailed instructions of what to implement and how]
                - **Context (read-only):** [files/dirs/docs to read]
                - **Touched (will modify/create):** [files/modules]
                - **Interfaces / Contracts:** [APIs/events/schemas/types]
                - **Tests:** [type + key scenarios/edge cases]
                - **Migrations / Data:** [DDL/backfill/ordering]
                - **Observability:** [logs/metrics/traces/alerts]
                - **Security & Permissions:** [authN/Z, PII, rate limits]
                - **Performance:** [targets/limits/complexity]
                - **Commands:** [local/CI commands to run]
                - **Risks & Mitigations:** [risk ‚Üí mitigation]

            3. **Append or create a new section** titled:
              \`\`\`markdown
              ## Code Review Attempts
              \`\`\`
              - Log the current review date and briefly summarize issues found.
              - Include clear, actionable guidance for each issue:
              \`\`\`
                - Issue: Missing validation for 'userId' in POST request
                  Fix: Add Joi schema check before model.create()
                - Issue: Race condition in cache refresh
                  Fix: Move redis.set() call inside transaction block
              \`\`\`
              - Keep a chronological list of past review attempts for full traceability.

            4. Ensure the resulting \`TODO.md\` remains **self-explanatory** ‚Äî a new developer should be able to read it and immediately understand:
              - What failed
              - Why it failed
              - What must be done next
              - Who or what performed each review
    `, task);

    if(isFullyImplemented(folder('TODO.md'))){
      try {
        await commitOrFix(
          fs.readFileSync(folder('TODO.md'), 'utf-8'),
          shouldPush,
          3,
          task
        );
      } catch (error) {
        // Log but don't block execution
        console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è  Commit failed in step4, continuing anyway:', error.message);
      }
    }else{
      if(fs.existsSync(folder('info.json'))){
        const json = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(folder('info.json'), 'utf8'));
        if(json.attempts % 3 === 0){
          // each 4 times we go to step4_1 to rewrite the todo from scratch
          await step4_1(task);
        }
      }
    }

    return execution;
